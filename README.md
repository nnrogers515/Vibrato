# Vibrato

This project is focused on the characterization of vibrato and non-vibrato from both human vocals as well as string instruments. To do this the project relied on implementations of Fast Fourier Transforms for analyzing wave forms, code for which can be located within this repository.

## Code for reading binary files and converting them to wave files was granted courtesy of Professor George Gollin from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
